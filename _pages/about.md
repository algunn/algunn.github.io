Hello! I'm interested in patterns that emerge from geophysical fluids. In my PhD, advised by [Doug Jerolmack](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nwGbdXUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), I study dunes in the field and with remote sensing, and turbidity currents in the lab. In my undergraduate I studied applied mathematics, and did an Honours year advised by [Maxim Nikurashin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xkTRzuUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) studying the ocean's meridional overturning circulation with theory and simulations.

Research
=======

At the moment I am studying:
* What sets the size of the giant dunes on Earth?
* What is the threshold of motion for sand grains blown by wind on other planets?
* What does the saltation layer look like in situ?
* What types of slope failures can initiate turbidity currents?

I have papers in review on the topics of:
* The diurnal atmopsheric boundary layer cycle over dune fields
* The internal boundary layer development over dune fields
