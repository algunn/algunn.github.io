Hello! I'm interested in patterns that emerge from geophysical fluids. In my PhD, advised by [Doug Jerolmack](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nwGbdXUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), I study dunes in the field and with remote sensing, and turbidity currents in the lab. In my undergraduate I studied applied mathematics, and did an Honours year advised by [Maxim Nikurashin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xkTRzuUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) studying the ocean's meridional overturning circulation with theory and simulations.
