Hello! I'm interested in patterns that emerge from geophysical fluids. I am starting a postdoc studying Mars' surface processes with [Mathieu Lap√¥tre](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=beQ7vU0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). I just defended my PhD, advised by [Doug Jerolmack](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nwGbdXUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), where I studied dunes in the field and with remote sensing, and turbidity currents in the lab. In my undergraduate I studied applied mathematics, and did an Honours year advised by [Maxim Nikurashin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xkTRzuUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) studying the ocean's meridional overturning circulation with theory and simulations.

Research
=======

At the moment I am studying:
* How can we measure the layer of grains being blown by wind in situ?
* What types of continental slope failures can initiate turbidity currents?

I have recent papers on the topics of:
* Why the giant dunes on Earth are the size they are
* How fast winds have to be to move sand grains on other planets
* How the extreme heat cycle influences the winds over dune fields
* How the roughness of dunes influences the winds over dune fields
