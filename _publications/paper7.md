excerpt: 'Sand seas are vast expanses of Earth''s surface that are covered in dunes---topographic patterns manifest from above-threshold winds and a supply of loose sand. Transitions in dune morphology and associated vegetation state are threshold phenomena that can switch states on kilometer or decadal scales due to small changes in climate. Predictions of the role of future climate change for sand-sea activity are sparse and contradictory. Here we examine the impact of climate on all of Earth''s presently-unvegetated sand seas, using ensemble runs of an Earth System Model for historical and future Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios. We find that almost all of the sand seas decrease in activity relative to present-day and industrial-onset for all future SSP scenarios, largely due to more intermittent sand-transport events. An increase in event wait-times and decrease in sand transport---in most cases linked to reduced off-season transport---is conducive to the rise of vegetation. We expect dune-forming winds will become more unimodal, and produce larger incipient wavelengths, due to weaker and more seasonal winds. Our results indicate that these qualitative changes in Earth''s desert landscapes can not be mitigated.'
